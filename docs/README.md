# Robotic Arm Documentation Index

This directory contains the detailed technical documentation for the Robotic Arm Project, organized by development phases.

## Development Phases

1. [Phase 1: Initial Setup](PHASE_1_INITIAL_SETUP.md)
   - Hardware wiring, Serial protocol, and environment configuration.

2. [Phase 2: Kinematics and Control](PHASE_2_KINEMATICS_AND_CONTROL.md)
   - Robot driver, Forward/Inverse Kinematics, and manual controls.

3. [Phase 3: Vision System Integration](PHASE_3_VISION_SYSTEM.md)
   - YOLOv8 detection, Camera calibration, and Distance estimation.

4. [Phase 4: Visual Servoing Centering](PHASE_4_VISUAL_SERVOING_CENTERING.md)
   - X/Y Axis alignment and Proportional control loops.

5. [Phase 5: Continuous Grab Controller](PHASE_5_CONTINUOUS_GRAB_CONTROLLER.md)
   - Real-time distance-based approach and integrated centering.

6. [Phase 6: Autonomous Pick and Place](PHASE_6_AUTONOMOUS_PICK_PLACE.md)
   - High-level workflow orchestration and sequential operations.
